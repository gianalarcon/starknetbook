# Installation

This chapter walks you through setting up your Starknet development
tools.

Essential tools to install:

1.  [Starkli](https://github.com/xJonathanLEI/starkli) - A CLI tool for
    interacting with Starknet. More tools are discussed in Chapter 2.

2.  [Scarb](https://github.com/software-mansion/scarb) - Cairoâ€™s package
    manager that compiles code to Sierra, a mid-level language between
    Cairo and CASM.

3.	[Katana](https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo) - katana is a blazingly fast local Starknet node, designed to support local development built by the Dojo team.
